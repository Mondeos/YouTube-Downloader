# Youtube-Downloader
Very Basic Youtube-Downloader,
using pytube and FFmpeg.

Very Basic GUI and functionality.
When downloading a video the audio is not the best, but it's good enough(for me) so I don't really care, but it has something to do with the FFmpeg conversion.
Otherwise, the sound is good.

Dependencies:

https://pypi.org/project/ffmpy/
